### Win vs Place/Exotics Arbitrage

Make use of discrepancies between win market and place market. Later with other markets. Download historic oddses, and analyze test out arbitrage strategies between the market. Formalize the strategy before running tests, don't just run a bunch of tests and see what has worked historically.

If there is something to win by doing this (+EV), then make some sort of system that monitors oddses for all Norwegian races and sends and alert when an opportunity opens. The end goal should be to have an app on the phone/web browser that does everything in setting up the bet except actually place it (due to it not being legal to automate betting).
